“Ola Data Analytics End to End Project | Data Analytics SQL, Excel & PowerBI Dashboard Project.”
In this Project, we take you step-by-step through a real-world data analytics project inspired by the ride-sharing industry. 

SQL for Data Extraction & Preparation: 
We begin by how to use SQL to query large datasets, clean and prepare data efficiently, and handle complex data structures. 
Excel for Data Analysis: Once the data is extracted, we move to Excel for deeper analysis. From data sorting and pivot tables to advanced formulas.

Power BI for Dashboard Creation: 
Finally, We create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that communicates key findings effectively, making complex data accessible to stakeholders.
